## API Endpoints
Here are the main endpoints provided by this service:

* GET /v1/recipes?query=pizza - Search for recipes by query
* GET /api/v1/recipes/{id} - Retrieve a specific recipe by ID
* GET /api/v1/recipes/{id}?excludedIngredients=15001 - Retrieve a customized recipe by ID, excluding specific ingredients and recalculating calories (interesting part! ðŸ’« )

## Configuration
To access the Spoonacular API, you need to set up your API key in the src/main/resources/application.properties file:

```properties
spoonacular.api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## IntelliJ HTTP Client
There is an IntelliJ HTTP client file that contains usage examples for the three API endpoints. You can find this file in the project directory and use it to test the API endpoints directly from IntelliJ IDEA.
check out the file [http-requests-examples.http](http-requests-examples.http)

## Testing
A test class is provided for the service. checkout the file [RecipeServiceImplTest.java](src%2Ftest%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fbmomani%2Ffoodapi%2Fservice%2Fimpl%2FRecipeServiceImplTest.java)
